                <p><strong>Entangled Lineages&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p><strong>By Georgia Lummert</strong></p>
                <p>The robot as slave, mere extension of our will, is a relentless, restless worker. These <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/robot">etymological roots</a> and <a href="https://vimeo.com/248887185">oceanic routes</a> not only tell us how we shape and perceive our worlds &mdash; and <a href="https://www.e-flux.com/journal/88/174279/the-stofflichkeit-of-the-universe-alexander-bogdanov-and-the-soviet-avant-garde/">what substance those worlds are made of</a> &mdash; but also make visible the kinds of relations we establish and live in. More importantly, they tell us to whom we deny certain interrelations, who we perceive as rootless, and <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/orphan?ref=etymonline_crossreference">who we see as not having a voice and will of its own</a>. Rather than attempting to create legitimising unambiguous human lineages, we might instead use translational histories and the act of translation itself as a chance to understand our mutual co-dependence and relatedness.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>In translation, Claudia de Lima Costa and Sonia E. Alvarez state in &ldquo;<a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/674381?mobileUi=0&amp;journalCode=signs&amp;">Dislocating the Sign: Toward a Translocal Feminist Politics of Translation</a>,&rdquo; &ldquo;there is a moral obligation to uproot ourselves, to be, even temporarily, homeless so that the other can dwell, albeit provisionally, in our home.&rdquo; Translation illuminates the fact that we are not alone in this world, and that this world is not one &mdash; but many, a pluriverse. Barbara Cassin <a href="https://www.e-flux.com/journal/80/100018/more-than-one-language/">writes</a>, &ldquo;Several languages are several worlds, several ways to open oneself to the world.&rdquo; The robot, too, lives in different languages and worlds.</p>
                <p>From (one of its) birth(s) in <a href="https://web2.mlp.cz/koweb/00/03/34/75/81/rur.pdf">Karel Čapek&rsquo;s drama R.U.R</a>. (Rossumovi Univerz&aacute;ln&iacute; Roboti, where the robot, designed by humans as cheap workforce deprived of any rights, finally revolts, through variations and translations of it like Alexandr Andriyevskys 1930s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qxPPeyy1rs">(finally failing) prospect of robots potentially bringing down capitalism</a>, till today where we have mostly forgotten its multilingual, entangled origins and revolutionary potential. Albeit not considered consciously, this history makes itself heard. It is the &lsquo;tłum&rsquo;, the &lsquo;mass&rsquo;, the &lsquo;crowd&rsquo; when we speak of it in Polish for example. Although official etymology has it that the word &lsquo;tłumacz&rsquo; is of Turkish origin &ndash; <a href="https://pl.wikisource.org/wiki/S%C5%82ownik_etymologiczny_j%C4%99zyka_polskiego/t%C5%82umacz">&lsquo;dilmac,&rsquo; from language, &lsquo;tyl&rsquo;, and the one that has it, &lsquo;mac</a>&rsquo; &ndash;, I cannot help but also hear the &lsquo;tłum&rsquo; in it, the crowded and messy place where my every enunciation, my every translational attempt departs from.&nbsp;</p>
                <p><br />To have a chance at being understood, I need to stifle, suppress, muffle &mdash; &lsquo;tłumić&rsquo; &mdash; a whole range of meanings. I need to cut some threads, violently uproot my word, make it an orphan, a robot to possess and become seen as a person that commands the language she is speaking in. Commanding a language, władać językiem, eine Sprache beherrschen, владеть языком all imply acts of subjugation, of conquest and appropriation &mdash; resorting to drastic, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrFMBIOZm-g">sometimes funny means</a>. <a href="https://tropicsofmeta.com/2020/02/17/reading-colonialism-in-parasite/">Commanding a certain language can offer access, recognition</a>, and allow my words to become heard as reasonable language, as knowledge. Thinking of language as a mere tool, a extension of my will that I can fully control, in short: thinking of language as of a &lsquo;robot-slave&rsquo; forgets the revolutionary potential they have, it obfuscates its uncontrollability and fleetingness, leading us to forget that it is <a href="https://www.e-flux.com/journal/80/100018/more-than-one-language/">language commanding us</a>, <a href="https://feministkilljoys.com/">giving directions to us</a>, and thus accommodating us &mdash; rather than the other way around. The metaphor &lsquo;commanding a language&rsquo; manifests itself in how the interfaces of current day neural translation programs are shaped. But they do not work on their own: the data their translation suggestions are based on represents but a fragment of our multilayered pluriverse. Their decisions are arbitrary, because every word we use shapes, tints and aligns the ones surrounding it.</p>
