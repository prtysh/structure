                    Artificial Intelligence, or ‘AI’, is a suite of technologies that includes machine learning, computer vision, reasoning, and natural language processing among others. In 1987 a computer was considered ‘intelligent’ because it beat the world’s highest ranked Chess player. Now, a computer program will be considered intelligent if it can drive a car. Machines are intelligent, we are told, because they can identify and respond to human emotions. Intelligence is a moving target then if defined by tasks like perception, pattern recognition, language processing or prediction.

                    AI exists in an awkward space between science and metaphor. If AI is what we think it is as told by popular culture and Hollywood-the beautiful and calculating fembot Eva in Ex Machina, the threatening synthetic intelligence called Skynet- then it remains a fantasy local to a particular time and place. However, AI’s component technologies are already here in object recognition technologies and language translation, shaping many aspects of social, cultural and political life. Metaphors and narratives are the shorthand by which we navigate new technologies. The history of science shows that how we describe something metaphorically becomes entangled in how we study it, thus shaping that artefact in terms of the metaphor (ref link). Phrases like ‘Information just wants to be free’ or ‘data is the new oil’ are all metaphors that have shaped what we think digital technologies are. Metaphors determine how a technology is developed, built, and will be regulated (or not regulated). For example, if, you think of AI as a child, or as a non-human species like an octopus then how will you regulate it?

                    A Is For Another is a response to the world-making and culturally homogenous approaches to AI emerging from places like Silicon Valley, Hollywood, and histories of the field as it has developed through Cognitive Psychology, Cybernetics, Computer Science and Linguistics since the 1950s. This project focuses on a distinctive and compelling aspect of AI: that it is shaped in terms of the human, and while we might think AI is about machines and robots, it is, in fact, about how we understand what it means to be human, and how our notions of the human are changing over time.

                    We want to show that  ‘intelligence’, ‘humans’, ‘machines’, ‘data’, ‘mind’ exist differently across a variety of cosmologies, sciences, theories and logics. A Is For Another puts diverse schools of scholarship, history, art and cultural work in conversation with each other. For example, in Hollywood cinema and much of the Euro-American SF genre and literature, robots convey an anxiety about the displacement or erasure of the human. In Japan, robots are perceived with less anxiety and with a mix of curiosity and amusement. Why? Or consider that viruses and robots, both non-human entities, are equally subjects of the Post-humanities; however, scholars such as Alexander Weheliye and Sylvia Wynters have written very different histories of ‘non-humans’ from the perspective of  Transatlantic Slavery, Colonialism and Colonial-era Plantations. How might Black Studies and Posthumanism be related, why are they not more related, and how do they resonate with artistic work, politics and organising at the intersection of racial justice and digital technologies?What happens when we read a history of intelligence from the perspective of Cognitive Psychology alongside a social-materialist inquiry into the women who were known as computers? How do we understand the work of machines and the work of humans as related?

                    We want to create forks and distractions in the path of how AI is being imagined and produced in the world. However, the purpose of this project is not to advance any new theoretical rationale for how AI could or should be designed instead. Nor does it describe how specific AI technologies like machine learning or computer vision work in the world, how they demonstrate bias, should be regulated, or might be used to address climate change. To know about these, visit another dictionary called The A to Z of AI here.

                    This project emerges from my doctoral research about the social and cultural shaping of AI/ autonomous systems. A Is For Another took shape thanks to a seminar series I conducted for the Berlin-based School of Disobedience called Another AI: Beyond Artificial Intelligences, in January-February 2020. Some of the longer pieces were written by people who participated in this program. The curriculum developed for that seminar became the inspiration for this website, built with the support of a Hivos Digital Futures Fellowship. A 2020 junior fellowship at the Berggruen Institute has also been an opportunity to develop many of the ideas here. I’m grateful to Johannes Bruder, Georg Diez, Armen Avanessian and participants at the School of Disobedience, Wesley Goatley, Nils Gilman, Orit Halpern (and everyone who attended the Planetary Futures Summer School, 2017), Alexander Mankowsky, Tobias Rees and Nishant Shah, among others, for being fellow travelers, teachers, and friends.
