            <p>This project focuses on a particular aspect of AI: that it is shaped in terms of the human. So while AI is about
                machine learning, cognition and robots, it is also about how we understand what it means to be human, how
                our notions of the human, and of the non-human, are changing over time, as are our inter-relationships. We
                want to show that &lsquo;intelligence&rsquo;, &lsquo;humans&rsquo;, &lsquo;machines&rsquo;, &lsquo;data&rsquo;
                and &lsquo;mind&rsquo; exist differently across a variety of cosmologies, sciences, and practices.
                <em>A Is For Another</em> puts diverse scholarship, art and cultural work in conversation with each other to
                further this thinking.</p>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence,
                <a href="https://ainowinstitute.org/AI_Now_2016_Report.pdf">&lsquo;AI&rsquo;,</a> is a suite of technologies that includes machine learning, computer vision, reasoning,
                and natural language processing, among others. It exists in an awkward and unique space as technology, metaphor
                and
                <a href="http://sts.hks.harvard.edu/research/platforms/imaginaries/">socio-technical imaginary</a>.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In 1987, a computer was considered &lsquo;intelligent&rsquo; because it beat the world&rsquo;s highest ranked
                chess player. Now, a computer will be considered intelligent if it can drive a car; or because it generates
                a
                <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200216184520.htm">response based on your facial expression</a>. Intelligence becomes a moving target defined by tasks like
                perception, pattern recognition, language processing or prediction. What is served by this idea?</p>
            <p>Now, AI&rsquo;s component technologies are employed in object recognition, language translation and recommender
                systems, among others, creating novel manifestations of existing personal, social and political relations.</p>
            <p>Metaphors and
                <a href="https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/ai-narratives/"> narratives</a> serve as shorthand for navigating new situations and technologies. The history of science
                <a href="https://books.google.de/books/about/Making_Truth.html?id=U3ljjHts3b8C&amp;redir_esc=y">shows us</a> that we use metaphors to describe something unfamiliar and new, and this becomes entangled in
                how we study it, thus shaping the artefact in terms of its metaphor. Phrases like &lsquo;information just
                wants to be free&rsquo; or &lsquo;data is the new oil&rsquo; have shaped what we think digital technologies
                are. Such
                <a href="https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/2169">metaphors</a>
                <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2xguw">determine</a> how a technology is developed, built, and will be regulated (or not regulated). For example,
                if you imagine artificial intelligence technologies as a child, a non-human species like an
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMPbEvtRaEw">
                octopus</a> or a mythical creature like a Centaur, then how will you regulate it?</p>
            <p>
                <em>A Is For Another</em> is a response to the world-making and culturally homogenous approaches to AI emerging
                from places like Silicon Valley and Hollywood. For example, in the European/US/UK Science Fiction genre,
                robots generally convey an anxiety about the displacement or erasure of human beings. The beautiful, calculating
                fembot Eva in
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_Machina_(film)"> Ex Machina</a> or the threatening synthetic intelligence
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator)">
                Skynet</a> in Terminator are such compelling fantasies.</p>
            <p>The interaction between pop culture,
                <a href="https://pure.itu.dk/portal/en/publications/technoanimism-in-japan(37f387c4-08ce-49b0-b8b4-8d71d42351e8)/export.html">cosmologies</a> and the
                <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0306312713509704">robotics industry</a> in Japan presents a different kind of &lsquo;robotic imaginary&rsquo; (Rhee). And &lsquo;robot&rsquo;
                is only one word for this fascinating and dramatic non-human/human being.
                <a href="https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9780230103597">Tokyo Cyberpunk</a> presents a panoply of vivid posthuman pop-cultural figures negotiating speculative socio-political
                scenarios, &ldquo;explor[ing] new possibilities of becoming at the rhizomatic intersection of different forms
                of intelligence, corporeality, and data processing.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Also, with
                <a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/the-robotic-imaginary">Jennifer Rhee</a> we ask of robots and all things AI: &ldquo;How does this figure engage the histories of
                under- valued, devalued, and exploited labor, particularly as they intersect with race, gender, and class?
                Who is being dehumanized in this robot figure? Whose humanness is constructed as familiar and sacrosanct?&rdquo;
                So what happens when we read a history of intelligence from the perspective of Cognitive Psychology alongside
                a social-materialist inquiry into the women who were known as computers?</p>
            <p>Or consider that mushrooms and robots, both non-human entities, are equally subjects of the
                <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9781118766804.wbiect220">
                Posthumanities</a>; Anna Tsing&rsquo;s ethnography of
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsutake">Matsutake</a> cultivation has been an inspirational text for many entries here. However,
                <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/alexweheliye/">Alexander Weheliye</a> and
                <a href="https://thenewinquiry.com/real-human-being/"> Sylvia Wynter</a> have written very different histories of &lsquo;non-humans&rsquo;, and the category of
                &lsquo;man&rsquo;, through the lens of Transatlantic slavery, colonialism and colonial plantations. Similarly,
                futurisms-
                <a href="https://monoskop.org/images/b/b2/Eshun_Kodwo_More_Brilliant_Than_the_Sun_Adventures_in_Sonic_Fiction.pdf#page=98">Afro-futurism</a>,

                forwards and back in time and space, both online and off. What imaginaries of automation, bodies, data and
                intelligence exist here?&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The purpose of this project is not to advance a new theoretical rationale for how AI could or should be designed.
                Nor does it describe how technologies like machine learning or computer vision work in the world, how they
                demonstrate bias, if they have ethics or not, or might be used to address the climate catastrophe. There
                are many resources about AI on these topics online.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Instead, we want to create forks and distractions in how &lsquo;AI&rsquo; is being imagined and produced in the
                world.</p>
