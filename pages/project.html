            <h2>This project&nbsp;</h2>
            <p>This project focuses on a distinctive aspect of AI: that it is shaped in terms of the human. So while AI is about
                machine learning, cognition and robots, it is also about how we understand what it means to be human, how
                our notions of the human, and of the non-human, are changing over time and what our inter-relationships could
                be. We want to show that &lsquo;intelligence&rsquo;, &lsquo;humans&rsquo;, &lsquo;machines&rsquo;, &lsquo;data&rsquo;
                and &lsquo;mind&rsquo; exist differently across a variety of cosmologies, sciences, and practices.
                <em>A Is For Another</em> puts diverse scholarship, art and cultural work in conversation with each other to
                further this thinking.</p>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence,
                <a href="https://ainowinstitute.org/AI_Now_2016_Report.pdf">&lsquo;AI&rsquo;,</a> is a suite of technologies that includes machine learning, computer vision, reasoning,
                and natural language processing, among others.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In 1987, a computer was considered &lsquo;intelligent&rsquo; because it beat the world&rsquo;s highest ranked
                chess player. Now, a computer program will be considered intelligent if it can drive a car. Machines are
                intelligent, we are told, because they can identify and respond to human emotions. Intelligence then becomes
                a moving target defined by tasks like perception, pattern recognition, language processing or prediction.</p>
            <p>Metaphors and
                <a href="http://lcfi.ac.uk/projects/ai-narratives-and-justice/ai-narratives/"> narratives</a> serve as shorthand for navigating new technologies &mdash; and AI</p>
            <p>exists in an awkward space of both technology and metaphor. If we perceive AI through popular culture &mdash;
                the beautiful, calculating fembot Eva in
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_Machina_(film)"> Ex Machina</a> or the threatening synthetic intelligence
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator)">
                    Skynet</a> in Terminator &mdash; then it is a fantasy. But AI&rsquo;s component technologies are already
                here and employed in object recognition and language translation, determining many aspects of social, cultural
                and political life.</p>
            <p>The history of science
                <a href="https://books.google.de/books/about/Making_Truth.html?id=U3ljjHts3b8C&amp;redir_esc=y">shows us</a> that we use metaphors to describe something unfamiliar and new, and this becomes entangled in
                how we study it, thus shaping the artefact in terms of its metaphor. Phrases like &lsquo;information just
                wants to be free&rsquo; or &lsquo;data is the new oil&rsquo; have shaped what we think digital technologies
                are. Such
                <a href="https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/2169">metaphors</a>
                <a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED311522"> determine</a> how a technology is developed, built, and will be
                <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2xguw">regulated</a> (or not regulated). For example, if, you think of AI as a child, or as a non-human species
                like an
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMPbEvtRaEw"> octopus</a>, then how will you regulate it?</p>
            <p>
                <em>A Is For Another</em> is a response to the world-making and culturally homogenous approaches to AI emerging
                from places like Silicon Valley and Hollywood; and from histories of the field as it has developed through
                Cognitive Psychology, Cybernetics, Computer Science and Linguistics since the 1950s.</p>
            <p>For example, in Hollywood cinema and the European/US/UK Science Fiction genre, robots convey an anxiety about
                the displacement or erasure of human beings. In Japan, however, robots are perceived with less anxiety; and
                &lsquo;robot&rsquo; is only one word for one kind of complex, dramatic non-human/human being. Steven Brown&rsquo;s
                <a href="https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9780230103597">Tokyo Cyberpunk</a> explores Japanese visual cultures of posthumanism, a panoply of vivid characters in speculative
                socio-political scenarios that &ldquo;explore new possibilities of becoming at the rhizomatic intersection
                of different forms of intelligence, corporeality, and data processing.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Or consider that fungi and robots, both non-human entities, are equally subjects of the
                <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9781118766804.wbiect220">
                    Posthumanities</a>; Anna Tsing&rsquo;s ethnography of
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsutake">Matsutake</a> cultivation has been an inspirational text for many entries here. However,
                <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/alexweheliye/">Alexander Weheliye</a> and
                <a href="https://thenewinquiry.com/real-human-being/"> Sylvia Wynter</a> have written very different histories of &lsquo;non-humans&rsquo;, and the category of
                &lsquo;man&rsquo;, through the lens of Transatlantic slavery, colonialism and colonial plantations. Similarly,
                futurisms-
                <a href="https://monoskop.org/images/b/b2/Eshun_Kodwo_More_Brilliant_Than_the_Sun_Adventures_in_Sonic_Fiction.pdf#page=98">Afro-futurism</a>,
                <a href="https://github.com/morehshin/TheRadicalOutside/blob/master/student_presentations/Gulf-Futurism/Gulf%20Futurism.pdf">Gulf-futurism</a>- are syntheses of geopolitics with pop-culture, and psychogeographies of bodies moving
                forwards and back in time, in space, both online and off. What imaginaries of automation, bodies, data and
                minds exist here? What happens when we read a history of intelligence from the perspective of Cognitive Psychology
                alongside a social-materialist inquiry into the women who were known as computers? </p>
            <p>The purpose of this project is not to advance a new theoretical rationale for how AI could or should be designed.
                Nor does it describe how specific AI technologies like machine learning or computer vision work in the world,
                how they demonstrate bias, or how they might be used to address climate change. (To know about these ideas,
                visit another new dictionary,
                <a href="https://atozofai.withgoogle.com/intl/en-US/"> the A to Z of AI</a>).</p>
            <p>Instead, we want to create forks and distractions in the path of how AI is being imagined and produced in the
                world.
