                <p><strong>History of the Human</strong></p>
                <p>In the European<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment"> Enlightenment</a> and period of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernity"> Modernity</a> that followed on its heels (roughly the 1700s to the early 1900s),<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOznwUEE9T8"> &lsquo;the human&rsquo; emerged</a> both as separate from nature and as more than &lsquo;mere&rsquo; machine. That is to say, we distinguished ourselves in two ways: not being driven by our instincts, and not existing as &lsquo;brute&rsquo; machines pre-programmed to do just one thing repeatedly. The world of non-humans &mdash; insects, minerals, bacteria, machines, trees &mdash; constituted a separate, inert landscape for humans to measure and know objectively, and through this to exploit and develop. Thus an outcome of the scientific discoveries, technological innovations, governance and culture of this time period was the notion of separation: of nature from culture, emotion from reason and subject from object. This is also related to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesianism">Cartesian notion</a> of the separation of mind from body.&nbsp;</p>
                <p><br />Some of these ideas of separation persist in our understanding of the human; for example, we understand &lsquo;intelligence&rsquo; as somehow &lsquo;contained&rsquo; in a brain or something brain-like, rather than as constituted by the interplay of social, cognitive, psychological and cultural practices over time. The social, scientific and cultural values that emerged during the Enlightenment and Modernity were also inextricably linked to Transatlantic slavery, colonial plantations and European colonialism. These global events radically altered our relationships with the land, nature, knowledge, and each other. At this time, black and brown people were considered to be less-than human; less than the Cartesian, rational, propertied, white, able-bodied, cis-heteronormative man. As Alexander Weheliye discusses extensively in Habeas Viscus (<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/161d/d50013e7073f781b13177fbac5fcdbbe0499.pdf">pdf</a>), we must acknowledge that our systems of knowledge are shaped by the notion of black and brown bodies as &lsquo;non-human&rsquo; others.</p>
