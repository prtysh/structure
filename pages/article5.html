The island was a sanctuary for marine life and the photographers were documenting its twenty-year history. Shedbird never made it out to sea, though; it died from a perforated stomach. There were 12 ounces of plastic inside it. The bird&rsquo;s parents had foraged for food in the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_garbage_patch"> great Pacific garbage patch</a> so it had grown into adolescence carrying plastic inside it. After it died, the photographers documented its death as well as the plastic that caused &mdash; this featured, among other things, bottle caps and lighters. This is a story about pollution and plastics but also of entanglement between humans and non-humans. The story of Shedbird is not only that we need to pollute less, which suggests a return to a kind of &lsquo;clean&rsquo; past (which is unlikely), but that we have to think about how ecologies change and new hybrids emerge. Some of these might be us humans, whose bodies and minds are re-shaped by<a href="https://www.natashadowschull.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/reviewcomment-Our-Metrics-Ourselves-_-Public-Books.pdf"> tracking through data</a> (pdf)<a href="http://maggic.ooo/Open-Source-Estrogen-2015"> open-source hormones</a>, doping in sports, medical or assistive technologies.

This is a kind of nature in which readers feel the pressures of extinction as well as the wonders of biodiversity.&rdquo; How can we live, flourish and grow together with other species for flourishing and growth amidst ruin, catastrophe and violence?</p>
