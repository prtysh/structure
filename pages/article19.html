                <p><strong>Deep Down DeepL</strong></p>
                <p><strong>By Georgia Lummert</strong></p>
                <p>It is probably not presumptuous or exaggerated to state that current popular translation interfaces render communication not only easier and faster but to some degree also more democratic and equal. The flipside, though, is this: they flatten our understanding of language, turning &lsquo;translation&rsquo; into a neat, contained and unidirectional linear thing with a clearly identifiable beginning and end. The pace at which these programs show me an equivalent for the word I search for in another language obfuscates the fact that translation always starts <a href="https://monoskop.org/images/6/66/Retallack_Joan_The_Poethical_Wager.pdf">&lsquo;in media&rsquo;s mess</a>&rsquo;, and has a long way to go &mdash; that it is by far not a question of preexisting equivalencies to look up and search for; that the work of neural machine translation is itself based on massive data processing. Translation is work, <a href="http://spheres-journal.org/the-disruptions-of-neural-machine-translation/">a time consuming task that several agents contribute to</a>. And that more often than not, <a href="http://spheres-journal.org/how-a-machine-learns-and-fails-a-grammar-of-error-for-artificial-intelligence/">relies on errors rather than success</a>. While it might dawn on most of us that the seemingly lofty business with words is not taking place in a vacuum, we still tend to imagine &lsquo;the internet&rsquo; and thus the translation services it offers as an immaterial thing.</p>
                <p><br />In reality, as Tabita Rezaires&rsquo; video <a href="https://vimeo.com/248887185">Deep Down Tidal </a>reminds us, the sea floor with its &ldquo;submarine fiber optic cable network&rdquo; is the internet&rsquo;s manifest material location. Translation, the &lsquo;перевод&rsquo;, leads and drives (водить) us through (пере) the water (вода), through an ocean of circulating meanings in mutual entanglement. It is an ocean we share with each other, albeit with very different histories of exile, forced migration, and <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translatio_imperii">conquest</a>. Contrary to this shared history, flat translation interfaces sustain a myth of neatly separable so-called &lsquo;source&rsquo; and &lsquo;target&rsquo; languages by opening up two strictly separate windows for each of them. There&rsquo;s no connection, no exchange, prior to the consciously made effort to translate, to say &lsquo;the same thing with other words&rsquo;, as if it didn&rsquo;t matter which words from which worlds I use. The world made up by these translation interfaces can be a pretty poor one to say the least. DeepL, the translation website, for example, presents a Eurocentric little universe in which humanity knows nine languages, all of them of &lsquo;European descent&rsquo;. Whatever else I type in there works as noise, as unintelligible and thus unreasonable gibberish that does not earn the decency of the label &lsquo;language&rsquo;. This stems from the powerful (one) world-making project of connecting &lsquo;the human&rsquo; to the one logos, the one language, the one reason of those in power. Instead of streamlining or fitting whatever is said in a <a href="https://monoskop.org/media/text/tsing_2015_the_mushroom_at_the_end_of_the_world/#page_37">hierarchy of scalables</a> in a flat universe, we might use translation as a tool to make visible and produce what Anna Tsing calls &ldquo;meaningful diversity&rdquo;. We might use it to find our place in the world and weave our translocal and translated worlds from there, the pluriverse, the various entangled and enmeshed cosmologies and waterworlds we live in.</p>
