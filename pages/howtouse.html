                    Designers Padmini and Pratyush suggested a generous interfaces approach to the architecture of this website. If we want to think about AI differently, or through other kinds of knowledge, then where do you start? A traditional online search assumes that a seeker already knows what they are looking for and can write it down in words in a box. Mitchell Whitelaw says: "Search is ungenerous: it withholds information, and demands a query. His generous interfaces approach suggests an alternative: “rich, browsable interfaces that reveal scale and complexity.”

            <p class="about">
                    This approach offers a synthesis of my own journey of learning about AI’s other possible futures and dimensions: meandering, serendipitous, non-linear. Sometimes this process has involved reading about the history of AI as documented in Stanford University’s archives. At another point in time it has been shaped by interacting with German futurologists imagining autonomous cars through animal intelligence. It has been both bewildering and illuminating; and not all connections are strong; sometimes the path is more illuminating than the destination.

                    This is a dictionary, and it is also a map of particular domains of knowledge not all of which appear related to each other at first glance. Domains within this include: Feminism, Science and Technology Studies, Design Philosophy, Post-humanism, Software Art, Black Studies. Artistic and cultural practice across and in relation to these fields are included. If you want to read personal, unique and whimsical entries offering different perspectives on humanity and AI, then you will find them in the ‘grid view’. Each entry is a piece of text with hyperlinks that are references to material outside this website. The ‘cumulative view’ is a visualisation of all the hyperlinks across all the entries in this dictionary. Every hyperlink in each entry has been given 4-5 tags, like ‘Non-humans’, ‘Machine’, ‘Post-humanism’, or ‘Robots’. Each writer assigned tags to each link they embedded in their text. 
            </p>
            <p class="about">
                    Each bubble in the cumulative view represents a tag; the larger the bubble, the more links across all the entries are associated with that tag. Each tag bubble is associated with other tag bubbles through the links, and these links are clickable; the bubbles themselves are not. The cumulative view is thus less like a network and more like a blooming-out of connections. Hopefully, this dictionary will offer new materials and ideas through which to make meaning of AI, and re-think what we mean by human intelligence. In the words of Anna Tsing, this is not a “logical machine” but an “open-ended assemblage”,  it “gesture[s] to the so-much-more-out-there.”

                    This dictionary is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive. It is a snapshot of small data aggregated slowly and mulled-over in a three year-period through seminars, workshops, summer schools and talks. It emerges from being situated in the English-language, Critical Humanities and Media and Digital Studies academia in Europe. This website was built between February and April 2020, and as such is a starting point for future pedagogy. It is not closed; it  is open to material that takes this thinking to new places.
