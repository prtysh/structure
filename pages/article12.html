                <p><strong>Perfection</strong></p>
                <p><strong>By Andrea Goetzke</strong></p>
                <p>Neural nets in<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/symbolic-vs-connectionist-a-i-8cf6b656927"> Connectionist AI</a> were modeled on human neural networks. Now with access to large amounts of data, these computational networks have surpassed the human capacity for fast and efficient computation. In this way, AI is modeled on the human, but achieves something better and beyond the human. For example, a self-driving car that can navigate traffic without being distracted by a text message. An<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=artificial+intelligence"> image search</a> for the term &lsquo;artificial intelligence&rsquo; shows human brains turned into ethereal circuit boards. This confirms the human as the starting point for something cleaner, lighter, more perfect. Some people imagine and<a href="http://www.singularity.com/aboutthebook.html"> write about</a> concepts such as the<a href="https://mindstalk.net/vinge/vinge-sing.html"> Singularity</a>: high capacity thinking minds without human bodies; bodies that disturb progress, seamlessness and perfection. Islands of perfection that use<a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/border-control-technology-biometrics"> algorithms to keep borders shut</a>; that outsource the dirty work. Impeccable houses cleaned by cheap labour. Secure and planned life schedules that have never learned to improvise. We are a society that invests in profitable technology development with convenient narratives, shiny products and &lsquo;objective&rsquo; predictions, rather than in messy, chaotic, time-consuming and unpredictable social and cultural deliberations.</p>
                <p>Most of the world today is made up of precarious and vulnerable beings, both human and non-human. Can perfection exist as an island in a sea of precarity? The perfect and the other? Donna Haraway's<a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/english/currentstudents/undergraduate/modules/fictionnownarrativemediaandtheoryinthe21stcentury/manifestly_haraway_----_a_cyborg_manifesto_science_technology_and_socialist-feminism_in_the_....pdf"> cyborg</a> and Anna Tsing's &lsquo;<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvc77bcc">contaminated diversity</a>&rsquo; acknowledge that purity and paradise are no longer options (if they have ever been) &mdash; certainly not after capitalism, patriarchy and colonialism. &lsquo;Contaminated diversity&rsquo; acknowledges and embraces relations between beings; how all beings are changed through encounters with others. The indeterminacies of encounters gives a different vision of the future than the controlled, perfect one that machines can calculate and predict for us.</p>
                <p>Thinking from the position of precarity, contamination, solidarity and imperfection, intelligence might be reframed as grown out of human experience and embodied minds that make sense of encounters. And doesn't intelligence also have to do with desire? Desires that are shaped through encounters? Arturo Escobar talks about how misleading Western dualisms of<a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/designs-for-the-pluriverse"> emotion vs. reason</a> are, because &ldquo;even the decision to be rational is an emotional decision.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>What does AI have to do with these questions?</p>
