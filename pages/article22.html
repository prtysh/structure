                <p><strong>Claiming Nature</strong></p>
                <p>&ldquo;We recognise that separating humanity from nature, from the whole of life, leads to humankind&rsquo;s own destruction and to the death of nations. Only through a re-integration of humanity into the whole of nature can our people be made stronger. That is the fundamental point of the biological tasks of our age. Humankind alone is no longer the focus of thought, but rather life as a whole&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
                <p>These words are from a 1934 text by German botanist, Ernst Lehmann, cited by Peter Staudenmaier in a text <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/janet-biehl-and-peter-staudenmaier-ecofascism-lessons-from-the-german-experience#fn1">co-authored with Janet Biehl</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/30/eco-fascists-and-the-ugly-fight-for-our-way-of-life-as-the-environment-disintegrates">about &lsquo;eco-fascism</a>&rsquo; in Germany&rsquo;s history. Lehmann believed that National Socialism (aka Nazis) was &lsquo;politically applied biology&rsquo;, referring to that party&rsquo;s adoption of genocide/eugenics as part of their political ideology and governance. Staudenmaier<a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/janet-biehl-and-peter-staudenmaier-ecofascism-lessons-from-the-german-experience#fn1"> writes</a> that some conservationists, eco-&lsquo;warriors&rsquo;, and back-to-nature environmentalists who de-centre human perspectives and listen to Nature on its own terms are also proponents of a type of xenophobic nationalism. As much as these movements may seem like a posthumanist centring of the non-human world, the &lsquo;return to nature&rsquo; narrative is a kind of enchanted fascism, a belief in &lsquo;going back&rsquo; to a better before. But &lsquo;before&rsquo; is usually a mythical, constructed time of local, religious, ethnic and religious &lsquo;purity&rsquo;.</p>
