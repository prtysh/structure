                <p><strong>Morality</strong></p>
                <p><strong>By Andrea Keleman</strong></p>
                <p>Popular AI narratives are infused with the hubris of creation; a clear dualism between<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein"> master and tool</a>, a top-down power relationship prefiguring subversion. And yet, AI and other technological tools far exceed the realms of<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/026327602761899246"> instrumentality, efficiency, and materiality</a>.<a href="http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/46-TECHNOLOGY-DURABLE-GBpdf.pdf"> As Latour writes</a>: &ldquo;Consider a tiny innovation commonly found in European hotels: attaching large cumbersome weights to room keys in order to remind customers that they should leave their key at the front desk every time they leave the hotel[,] instead of taking it along on a tour of the city. An imperative statement inscribed on a sign &mdash; 'Please leave your room key at the front desk before you go out' &mdash; appears to be not enough to make customers behave according to the speaker's wishes. Our fickle customers seemingly have other concerns, and room keys disappear into thin air. But if the innovator, called to the rescue, displaces the inscription by introducing a large metal weight, the hotel manager no longer has to rely on his customers' sense of moral obligation.&rdquo; Where the sign fails to convince hotel customers to act morally, the new technology &mdash; the metal weight &mdash; succeeds.</p>
                <p>Here, the technology is not a mere tool in the hand of its maker, but something that brings about a new moral order. Thus new technologies represent bifurcations in the unfolding of time, as every new innovation brings about a slightly altered moral order that builds on the previous one. The more technologies proliferate, the more the initial order becomes opaque. In this process, technologies transform from automatic tools in the hands of their masters into autonomous moral agents.</p>
