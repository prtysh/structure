                <strong>Arts of Navigation</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>By Steph Holl-Trieu</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Intelligence as understanding is prefigured in the act of navigation. To create a solution, one must first come
                to know what the problem is. The reverse can be found in many forms of technological &ldquo;innovation&rdquo;,
                created under the guise of solving virtual problems. In the end, these prove to be false novelties, trojan
                horses ushering in real problems which did not exist before. Solutions-sans-problems can quickly become
                <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngZ0K3lWKRc"> insults to life itself</a>. Even in assumed novelty we find
                <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612876/this-is-how-ai-bias-really-happensand-why-its-so-hard-to-fix/">
                conservatism</a> or ignorance. Yet, life does create problems, issues, troubles&mdash;forcing new solutions.
                The absolution of any form of action or exploration of solutions may be equally conservative and violent.
                Life, or the terrain we find ourselves on, is only ever explored in fragments.</p>
            <p>The experience of hunting down these fragments is aptly demonstrated by the act of
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKzeknnztDo">
                scouting in Sid Meier&rsquo;s video game Civilization</a>. Wherever the scout follows the click of the cursor,
                tiles reveal themselves in all their splendour (colour, resource, terrain, etc.), but as the scout moves
                further away, the tiles fall back into sepia, muting the information that was once discovered. We could think
                about our life-in-fragments as the hexagonal tiles in the game, only our axes of exploration don&rsquo;t
                run across a 3D-rendered flattened surface, but reach into the inner core of the earth, boil in volcanic
                magma, stratify soil, force themselves into cells and cells in cells, or ribonucleic acid in protein shells:
                an amnesiac exploration, expanding and contracting space and time. Sometimes we forget what we have discovered
                about our environments as quickly as we have learned about them. Countering amnesia by tilting, zooming,
                pivoting, mapping, orienting and navigating in a step-by-step, fragment-by-fragment manner is nothing more
                than (or short of) applying algorithmic methods.</p>
            <p>Often treated as novelties, or foreign bodies seeking scepticism and observance, Matteo Pasquinelli writes that
                <a
                    href="https://www.academia.edu/39635788/3000_Years_of_Algorithmic_Rituals_The_Emergence_of_AI_from_the_Computation_of_Space">
                algorithms actually date back more than 3000 years</a>. In the ancient Hindu Agnicayana ritual, devotees
                symbolically recomposed the fragmented body of the god Prajapati in a falcon-shaped fire-altar following
                step-by-step instructions according to a geometric plan. Rather than being a new invention and sole heir
                to the siege of Enlightenment, territorialised within the industrial West, algorithms, Pasquinelli says,
                &ldquo;are among the most ancient and material practices, predating many human tools and all modern machines&rdquo;
                and &ldquo;grow out of the data produced by collective intelligence.&rdquo; Navigation in this sense can
                be understood as the calculation of space that follows a sequence in time. In other words, it is space mapping
                out the problem over time that gives form to &lsquo;intelligence&rsquo;. While Hindu devotees used algorithms
                to secure gifts from the gods, today algorithmic navigation in vast seas of data is a practice to treat complexity-induced
                vertigo &mdash; provided the map is drawn with sensitivity so as to not insult life itself.</p>
