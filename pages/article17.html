                <p><strong>Cosmologies</strong></p>
                <p>What is commonly understood as &lsquo;AI&rsquo; today is as much about business and industrial imaginaries as it is about culture and computation. These<a href="https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/D/bo20836025.html"> socio-technical imaginaries</a> are part of a particular cosmology: beliefs about how our existence is architected, its histories and futures, and the relationships between parts of a universe and its whole. Cosmologies bring forth narratives, maps of the world, stories, values, societies, structures and feelings. It is difficult to acknowledge the existence of other cosmologies because our own can be so totalising: they organise our understanding of existence. As AI appears to mimic human behaviour and intelligence, it brings our cosmologies into focus &mdash; it raises questions about what it means to be human. Climate crises resulting from human activity, and living alongside threatening and resilient viruses, make us examine our place amidst non-human others.</p>
                <p>Perspectives on the non-human world, the &ldquo;world-without-us&rdquo;, as<a href="https://books.google.de/books/about/In_the_Dust_of_This_Planet.html?id=p0h-6VWujy0C&amp;redir_esc=y"> Eugene Thacker puts it</a>, can be terrifying and difficult to grasp. This is the human being subtracted from the world as we know it; the world that the horror genre, the occult, the mystical and demonism open up to us; the world in a time of large-scale climate disaster. The world-without-us is also what existed before humans showed up &mdash; and what will remain after we leave. Before that, however, we are constantly making the earth ours; the world-for-us built through politics and society.</p>
                <p><br />There are other cosmologies out there, it seems, that propose a different construction of the world and the place of humans in it. Metaphorically speaking, embracing other cosmologies is like re-thinking transport: like, thinking outside the concept of getting from A to B on a bus, and considering<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychokinesis"> telekinesis</a> instead. This is a paradigm shift. For example, Yuk Hui&rsquo;s approach to<a href="https://www.e-flux.com/journal/86/161887/cosmotechnics-as-cosmopolitics/"> cosmotechnics</a> is about letting go of concepts such as the &lsquo;human&rsquo; and &lsquo;technology&rsquo; and entering an entirely different cosmological order comprising<a href="https://books.google.de/books?id=rc5NfRpwpZ0C&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=Qi+below+forms&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M-5kk3yy5e&amp;sig=ACfU3U1KT-Cn0BVUjJ7m9KOhGctiqA7Row&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwit0o_lgNvoAhWNbsAKHbp9CcoQ6AEwGHoECAsQQQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Qi%20below%20forms&amp;f=false"> Qi</a> (something instrumental or concrete) and<a href="https://www.iep.utm.edu/daoism/"> Dao</a> (something like an approach, &ldquo;the way&rdquo;) and their interaction.<a href="https://www.blackquantumfuturism.com/about"> Black quantum futurism</a> is the disruption of space-time, envisioning a new chrono-political order: one in which history and future exist in the present, simultaneously.<a href="http://www.indigenous-ai.net/"> Indigenous epistemologies</a> approach AI in terms of<a href="https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/lewis-arista-pechawis-kite"> &lsquo;making kin&rsquo; with machines</a> through mutual respect. But different cosmologies cannot be tried on as if this season&rsquo;s fashion; a new or different cosmology necessitates the reordering of fundamental beliefs about society, institutions and relationships, and what we think the human is.</p>
