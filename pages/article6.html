                <p><strong>The Cyborg</strong></p>
                <p>The word<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg"> cyborg</a> is a portmanteau of &lsquo;cybernetic&rsquo; and &lsquo;organism&rsquo;. It was coined by scientists Manfred Clynes and Nathan Kline in 1960 (<a href="http://web.mit.edu/digitalapollo/Documents/Chapter1/cyborgs.pdf">pdf</a>) as a way to talk about how the human body would need to be augmented and enhanced if it had to survive in extraterrestrial space. The first cyborg was a white rat that the scientists implanted with a small osmotic pump that released chemicals intended to change the animal&rsquo;s physiology.</p>
                <p>The cyborg exists exists and is valourised as a synthetic, malevolent intelligence in the Hollywood<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(franchise)"> Terminator franchise</a>; but in Donna Haraway&rsquo;s<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120214194015/http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/Haraway/CyborgManifesto.html"> Cyborg Manifesto</a>, first published in the Socialist Review in 1983, it is an ironic and mythical figure that dissolves boundaries between human and non-human. Haraway&rsquo;s Manifesto<a href="https://nplusonemag.com/issue-28/reviews/monstrous-duplicated-potent/"> can sometimes feel impenetrable</a>, so we might be forgiven for thinking of her cyborg in terms of Lynn Randolph&rsquo;s iconic<a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/314759461441708132/"> image</a> accompanying Haraway&rsquo;s book, Cyborgs, Simians and Women: The Reinvention of Nature (full pdf<a href="https://monoskop.org/images/f/f3/Haraway_Donna_J_Simians_Cyborgs_and_Women_The_Reinvention_of_Nature.pdf"> here</a>). In this illustration, we see a smiling sphinx at a keyboard, &ldquo;her hands poised to play with the cosmos, words, games, images, and unlimited interactions and activities,&rdquo; raised up in low Cobra-pose, wearing the shamanic White Tigress headdress. Her body is a circuit board, while galaxies, theorems and a game of tic-tac-toe swirl in the vast ether behind her. Part machine, part woman, part animal, Randolph&rsquo;s figure is a chimera.</p>
                <p>But a cyborg is not necessarily a strict human-machine merger; it is an imaginary for &ldquo;thinking with&rdquo;.<a href="https://www.viewpointmag.com/2017/05/08/cthulhu-plays-no-role-for-me/"> According to Sophie Lewis</a>, the cyborg is &ldquo;a luminous translation of the Marxist idea that we make history, but not under conditions of our choosing. It is a timely suggestion that political science address the fact that we are full of bubbling bacteria, inorganic prostheses, and toxic economic mythologies.&rdquo; The Manifesto, together with much of Haraway&rsquo;s early work, dismantles ideas of the &lsquo;natural&rsquo; and &lsquo;artificial&rsquo;. Haraway proposes that we are already cyborg, constituted by networks and technologies that go beyond the digital. In a 1997<a href="https://www.wired.com/1997/02/ffharaway/"> interview</a> with Hari Kunzru, Haraway discusses the &lsquo;natural&rsquo; body as imagined by sport, saying: &ldquo;Before the Civil War, right and left feet weren't even differentiated in shoe manufacture. Now we have a shoe for every activity.&rdquo; Winning the Olympics in the cyborg era isn't just about running fast. It's about "the interaction of medicine, diet, training practices, clothing and equipment manufacture, visualization and timekeeping.&rdquo; Drugs or no drugs, training and technology make every Olympian a node in an international technocultural network &mdash; just as &lsquo;artificial&rsquo; as any athlete at their steroidal peak.</p>
                <p><br />September 2010 was the fiftieth anniversary of the coining of the term &lsquo;cyborg&rsquo;. Over the course of that month, Tim Maly assembled 50 instances of the use of the word to a dedicated Tumblr called<a href="https://50cyborgs.tumblr.com/"> 50 posts about cyborgs</a>.</p>
